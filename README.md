# DeepSpace3
Semester long project
There are multiple goals for this project, which will be an asteroids clone. To make it a clone, more or less, is the first goal. Secondary goals include adding power ups and menus. Tertiary goals would be fun stuff like easter eggs or animations or something.
How to accomplish first goals:
First I need to build classes for the different objects that we will be dealing with.
Then I need figure out how to use the gui. Based on the book, I guess I'll try using JavaFX.
Then figure things out? I'm honestly still not 100% sure how I will implement everything just yet.
